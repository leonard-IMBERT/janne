# JANNE (JUNO Adversorial Neural Network Experiment)

This project aim to give a informal structure to implement Adversorial Neural Network (ANN) to run against reconstruction algorithms of JUNO

## Conventions

This repo expose mutliple classes.

Each classes with the name `I...` is an informal interface, aka. a contract that your class need to implment for them to be usable in the framwork


## Requirements
 - python version 3.9.14
